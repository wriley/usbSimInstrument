usbSimInstrument
================

This is a half-finished project I started several years ago for a flight simulator panel. It is a DLL to drive a stepper board<sup>1</sup>. Each stepper board has a serial number and calibration values that can be set/edited with the Calibrator tool<sup>2</sup>. Micosoft Visual C# is required to compile.
